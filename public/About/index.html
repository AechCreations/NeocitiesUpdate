    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm hazelehn. I exist and thats kinda it.
    <br>I'm a fan of SF6, Photography, Art, and especially Night In The Woods. I originally made this site back in 2024 January as a part of my stem class, but ended up getting really demovitvated and stopped working on it.
    <br>I'm planning on using this site now just as a fully personal thing. I'll be posting whatever I want, write however im feeling, and if I end up getting demovitaved again expect this site to stop getting updates.
    <br>The site is still in very early development so don't expect everything to work very well. I'm new to this be polite plsâ™¥

    There's also M.I.A.H. partially self insert, partially just a character, mostly just a graffiti tag.

        MIAH Stands for Missing In Action Happily if you care. I know its supposed to have the dots after every word cuz its an acronym but idc.
        Yeah its corny a little but I thought it seemed cool. I'm really bad at drawing so expect any drawings you see from me to look bad.
