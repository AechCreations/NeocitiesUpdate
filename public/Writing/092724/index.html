<h1>"My mom is dead and everything is worse now."</h1>
<p>
If you don't know what this is a quote from, you're probably thinking "jesus thats one way to start a post." I think I'd be more suprised if you didn't know the quote, actually.
This is a quote from the famous "Free Churro" episode of Bojack Horseman. God I probably sound like a loser. I can't know how you're gonna feel reading this but I feel like people are gonna roll their eyes at this.
<br> Who am I kidding no one's reading this
</p>
<p>Although my mother isn't dead, I feel like this is the best way I could sum up how I felt waking up this morning. I spent from 6:30pm to 11:00pm last night just sitting at my phone, braindead.
All of this started mostly because of Street Fighter. Yes I know how embarrassing that is, yes I know I shouldn't be getting this mad at ranked, but I would say that it was less about how much I was losing, more of all of the feelings it caused.
</p>
<p>
    One of my biggest problems is that I tend to let my emotions take over when I get into any negative mood. Especially in sf6, one of my worst cycles I create is when I'm in a bad mood about something else, I end up doing so much worse in game, and then it causes me to feel even worse about everything.
    I'm pretty sure I'm plateauing right now, doesn't help how I'm feeling about everything else, but it really gives me that reaction of "oh my god im the worst im never going to get better everything sucks"  to not only the game but other things too.
