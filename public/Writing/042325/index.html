    Isn't it funny how I've written something about the same time the past 3 months
    <br>
    <br> Anyways I relapsed last night
</p>

<p>
    I'm not sure what else to say about it, but it happened, and I'm pissed about it.
    Today would have been the 200th day I was self harm free.
    <br> I'm really mad that I wasn't even able to get actual cuts. The knife I used was way to dull.
    I just wanted some sort of reminder of what I did. One that would last. All I really have are these three pathetic marks that look like rashes.
    I know self harm and getting better isn't always just as simple as not doing it, but I really wanted to be stronger.
    <br> My girlfriend said that she'd come up for me. I really want her to but I don't want to do that to her. I feel like I'm being manipulative or something.
    I'm really happy she's there for me, I just feel like I don't deserve it. I love her so much and I'm so happy she cares for me. I just wish I could do more.
    <br>
    <br> I'm not really sure where I'm going with this entire rant. I'm just pissed about relapsing.
<br>
<br> I hope I can get to 200 days again.
